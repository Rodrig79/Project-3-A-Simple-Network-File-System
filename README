//// My own rating on the functionality ///////////////////
Rating: A, B, C, D, or F?
A
Explanation: 
The file system works as intended and completes all test examples provided by the assignment pdf
along with all tests provided below. The majority of test cases were performed in many different situations
including edge cases such as files being almost or completely full and the disk being almost or completely full.
A large number of edge case bugs have been found so there should be extremally few if any bugs in the functionality
of the file system.

//// Test cases ///////////////////////////////////////////
All of these commands were done in this exact order

Nick's tests
New FS was started here
-------------
NFS> create toolongname
504 File name is too long

NFS> mkdir toolongname
504 File name is too long

NFS> create f
success

NFS> cat f


NFS> head f 5



NFS> create f
502 File exists

NFS> cd f
500 File is not a directory

NFS> stat f
Inode block: 2
Bytes in file: 0
Number of Blocks: 1
First block: 0

NFS> append f <80 character long string>
success

NFS> cat f
<same 80 character long string>

NFS> head f 81
<same 80 character long string>

NFS> head f 5
10101

NFS> stat f
Inode block: 2
Bytes in file: 80
Number of blocks: 2
First block: 3

This command was repeated 94 times:
NFS> append f <80 character long string>
All 94 results were the same
success

NFS> stat f
Inode block: 2
Bytes in file: 7600
Number of blocks: 61
First block: 3

NFS> append f <78 character long string>
success

NFS> stat f
Inode block: 2
Bytes in file: 7678
Number of blocks: 61
First block: 3

NFS> append f 01
success

These two tests were not performed sequentially rather each one was run with identical
starting conditions in a seperate session from the other, both give the same results after their initial responses
------------------------------
NFS> append f 01
success

NFS> append f hello
508 Append exceeds maximum file size
-------------------------------

NFS> stat f
Inode block: 2
Bytes in file: 7680
Number of blocks: 61
First block: 3

NFS> append f 01
508 Append exceeds maximum file size

NFS> stat f
Inode block: 2
Bytes in file: 7680
Number of blocks: 61
First block: 3

NFS> rm f
success

NFS> ls
empty folder

NFS> mkdir test
success

NFS> stat test
Directory name: test/
Directory block: 2

NFS> cd test
success

NFS> ls
empty folder

NFS> create file
success

NFS> mkdir dir
success

NFS> ls
file dir/

NFS> stat dir
Directory name: dir/
Directory block: 4

NFS> home
success

NFS> rmdir test
507 Directory is not empty

NFS> cd test
success

NFS> rmdir file
500 File is not a directory

NFS> rm dir
501 File is a directory

NFS> rm file
success

NFS> rmdir dir
success

NFS> ls
empty folder

NFS> home
success

NFS> rmdir badname
503 File does not exist

NFS> rm badname
503 File does not exist

NFS> rmdir test
success

NFS> mkdir test
success

NFS> mkdir test
502 File exists

mkdir <dirname> was repeated with different names until the directory contained 10 directories, all responded success

NFS> mkdir test11
506 Directory is full

NFS> create test11
506 Directory is full

NFS> cd test11
503 File does not exist

NFS> cd test
success

NFS> mkdir test
success

these last two test cases were repeated a little over 1000 times

NFS> stat test
Directory name: test/
Directory block: 1021

NFS> create file
success

NFS> stat file
Inode block: 1022
Bytes in file: 0
Number of blocks: 0
First block: 0

NFS> append file <80 character long string>
success

NFS> stat file
Inode block: 1022
Bytes in file: 80
Number of blocks: 2
First block: 1023

NFS> append file <80 character long string>
505 Disk is full

NFS> create file2
505 Disk is full

NFS> mkdir test2
505 Disk is full

NFS> rm file
success

NFS> mkdir test2
success

NFS> mkdir test3
success

NFS> mkdir test4
505 Disk is full

NFS> rmdir test3
success

NFS> cat test
501 File is a directory

NFS> head test 5
501 File is a directory

NFS> append test hello
501 File is a directory

NFS> cat notafile
503 File does not exist

NFS> head notafile 5
503 File does not exist

NFS> append notafile hello
503 File does not exist

NFS> stat notafile
503 File does not exist
